# Router Dataplane

This project is a comprehensive simulator of a router in a computer network. It is written in C language and leverages functions from various libraries to manage network packets effectively.

## README Usage

1. sudo pip3 install grip / sudo apt install grip
2. grip README.md  

## Features

- **IPv4 Packet Handling**: Receives IPv4 packets and processes them according to the following steps:
  - Checks the destination MAC address in the MAC table. If the MAC address is not found, it sends an ARP request to the router to obtain the MAC address.
  - Forwards the packet once the MAC address is obtained.
  
- **ICMP Packet Handling**: Manages ICMP packets with the following functionalities:
  - Handles cases where there is not enough time to forward the packet.
  - Handles cases where there is no route to the destination host.
  - Forwards the packet if there is a route and sufficient time.
  
- **ARP Packet Handling**: Deals with ARP packets by:
  - Checking if it knows the MAC address of the destination. If found, it forwards the packet.
  - If the MAC address is not known, it sends an ARP request to obtain the MAC address.
  - Responds to ARP requests by sending its own MAC address.

- **Timeouts and ICMP Responses**: Detects timeout situations and sends appropriate ICMP messages:
  - When there is a timeout, it sends ICMP Time Exceeded messages.
  - When there is a network unreachable situation, it sends ICMP Destination Unreachable messages.

## Code Usage

1. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed, including the `<arpa/inet.h>` library.
2. Compile the project using a C compiler, for example: `gcc main.c -o router`.
3. Run the compiled program: `./router route_table.txt`.

Make sure to provide the `route_table.txt` file for proper router operation.
